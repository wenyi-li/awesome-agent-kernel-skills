# Evaluation Report

Evaluation of the `tilegym-monkey-patch-kernels-to-transformers` skill before publication through NVSkills-Eval.

This benchmark summarizes 3-Tier Evaluation from NVSkills-Eval results for the skill. The goal is to document whether the skill is safe, discoverable, effective, and useful for agents before it is published for broader workflow use.

## Evaluation Summary

- Skill: `tilegym-monkey-patch-kernels-to-transformers`
- Evaluation date: 2026-05-29
- NVSkills-Eval profile: `external`
- Overall verdict: FAIL
- Tier 3 live agent evaluation: not available in this report

## Agents Used

- Tier 3 agent details were not available in this report.

## Metrics Used

Reported benchmark dimensions:

- Security: checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access.
- Correctness: checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output.
- Discoverability: checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant.
- Effectiveness: checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it.
- Efficiency: checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work.

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run:

- No Tier 3 evaluation signal details were available in this report.
