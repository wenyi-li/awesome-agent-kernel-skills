## Overview

PDL/GDC allows overlapping execution of dependent kernel launches. The primary kernel signals it is finishing; the secondary kernel begins before the primary fully completes.

## How It Works

```cuda
// Primary kernel signals near completion
cudaGridDependencySynchronize();  // or PTX equivalent

// Secondary kernel can start overlapping with primary's tail
// Enabled by default on SM100 (opt-in on SM90)
```

## Blackwell Default Behavior

On SM100, PDL is **enabled by default** — no opt-in needed. This means:
- Back-to-back kernel launches naturally overlap
- Memory fences ensure correctness for dependent data
- Reduces kernel launch gaps in compute-heavy pipelines

## When It Matters
- Chains of small kernels (e.g., MoE dispatch → compute → combine)
- Pipeline-parallel training with many sequential kernel launches
- Reduces overall wall-clock time without code changes on Blackwell
