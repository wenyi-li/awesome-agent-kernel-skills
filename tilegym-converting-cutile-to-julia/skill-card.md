## Description: <br>
Converts cuTile Python GPU kernels (@ct.kernel) to cuTile.jl Julia equivalents, handling kernel syntax translation, 0-indexed to 1-indexed conversion, broadcasting differences, memory layout (row-major to column-major), type system mapping, and launch API differences. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
